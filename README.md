## Introduction
"hello, galaxy" solutions are designed to go beyond the "hello, world" examples to show features being used in robust examples. The goal is minimize time developers need to implement new features.
The definition of a robust example is up to interpretation and may change over time. For now, a robust example...
- Provides a real solution (function or full application)
- Specifies the features being used
- Adheres to many of the sotware best practices (commented, little/no redundant code, no hard-coding, has error handling, ...)
This definition can change as needed.
